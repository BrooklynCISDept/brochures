## CUNY Ph.D Program

The Ph.D. Program in Computer Science at CUNY is conducted as a consortium of several senior colleges and the Graduate Center, located on 34th St. and 5th Ave. in Manhattan; students enrolled in the program may take courses at any of the locations. Most of the advanced graduate courses and seminars are offered at the Graduate Center, although many are given at Brooklyn College.

All 7000-level courses of the Brooklyn College CIS Department may be credited toward the CUNY doctoral degree with permission of the Executive Officer of the doctoral program. Many members of the CIS department faculty are also members of the doctoral faculty, and students who wish to do supervised research may work with any of those faculty members. About 10-15 Ph.D. students at Brooklyn College are supported, either by a tuition grant, as grad fellows, or through research projects. A number of doctoral students based at Brooklyn College get Ph.D.s each year.

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="callout">
Keep in mind that the Ph.D. in computer science is not necessary for most jobs in the field; it is intended to prepare selected students for careers of leadership in industry, research, and teaching in academia.
</div>
It is possible for a student with an outstanding record to be admitted to the Ph.D. program directly after receiving the Bachelor's degree; however, it is more common to be admitted after receiving a Master's degree. Students who wish to obtain the Ph.D. degree are invited first to complete the Master's degree at Brooklyn College, where their Master's work will count toward the CUNY doctoral degree.

### Admissions Requirements 

All applicants to the Ph.D. are required to have a minimum average of B in their undergraduate work and to have completed coursework equivalent to an undergraduate major in computer science. Exceptions may be made for students with degrees in related fields or with extensive experience in computer science.

Applicants must take the Graduate Record Exam. It is strongly recommended that the applicant also submit scores for the Computer Science advanced area test.

Students whose first language is not English are required to take the TOEFL. Applicants must also submit two letters of recommendation and an official transcript.
