Applicants for the master's degree programs in Computer Science or Information Systems are expected to have the equivalent of at least 15 credits in computer and information science and related areas, including all of the following: knowledge of a high-level computer language (preferably Java or C++), knowledge of assembly language and computer architecture, a course in discrete structures, a course in data structures, and a course in calculus. Applicants for the M.S. degree in Information Science are expected to have all the courses listed plus a course in probability and statistics.

Students interested in the M.S. degree in Health Informatics must offer at least 18 credits in undergraduate or graduate courses in health and nutrition sciences and/or health-related fields. Applicants are also expected to have the equivalent of at least 12 credits in computer and information science, including all of the following: knowledge of a high-level computer language (preferably Java or C++), a course in discrete structures and a course in data structures.

Students who do not have all of these requirements may be accepted with the condition that they complete these courses at the undergraduate level.

Students who majored in any area as an undergraduate can be accepted as graduate students in computer science. Approximately half of the applicants majored in computer science as undergraduates. Other applicants majored in mathematics, engineering, physical and natural sciences, social sciences, fine arts, education, and so on.




## Applications

Students can apply online at <https://websql.brooklyn.cuny.edu/admissions/graduate/>. As part of their application, students are required to submit transcripts from all colleges that they have attended, two letters of recommendation, and TOEFL scores if appropriate (see below). Brooklyn College uses a self-managed application form for graduate students, in which the student is responsible for collecting all materials required for admission.

## TOEFL
Students whose native language is not English are required to take the TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) examination before applying for admission. Students whose native language is not English but who have lived in the United States for several years may be exempt from these requirements.

The Master's program accepts students from a wide variety of backgrounds. Each semester more than 100 students, from a multitude of countries around the globe, apply for admission. Many students come from Asia (including China, Korea, Taiwan, India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh). There are a number of students whose home country is in the Middle East (including Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, and Israel). Other applicants come from Western or Eastern Europe, including a number from Russia. Still others come from Africa, South America, and Central America. Of course, many of the applicants come from Brooklyn, the entire metropolitan area, and elsewhere in the United States.

### Prerequisite Courses

When a student is admitted to a Master's program, the student will receive a letter describing which (if any) prerequisite courses must be completed. If a student believes that there is a mistake in this list, the student should contact the Graduate Deputy Chair as quickly as possible to resolve the problem.

### Deadlines for Matriculation

In general, Brooklyn Collegeâ€™s deadlines for admission are April 1 for the Fall semester, November 1 for the next Spring semester. If a student misses the deadline, the application can still be considered.

### Non-Matriculation Students

Students who do not meet the entrance requirements or who miss the application deadline may be admitted with non-matriculated status. A student in non-matriculated status is restricted in many ways; most important, the student may not register after completing 15 credits. After completing six credits with a 3.0 average, a student should apply for matriculated status. 7000-level courses taken as non-matriculated students will count toward the degree once the student has become matriculated

International students, or students who need to obtain a visa of some type in order to study at Brooklyn College, cannot register as non-matriculated students. Such students must be accepted as matriculated students in order to attend Brooklyn College.
