The department provides a stimulating environment for those interested in studying computer science. There is enthusiastic interaction among students and faculty, and there are strong research groups. Advanced graduate students have the opportunity of doing research under the guidance of department faculty. The department has significant grant support for research, with faculty supported by such agencies as NIH, NSF, ONR, and NASA.

The department's academic goal in the graduate program is to train graduate students for careers in computing research and applications. The two primary graduate programs of the department are a Master of Arts (M.A) degree in Computer Science, oriented toward computer science research and development applications; and a Master of Science (M.S.) degree in Information Systems, oriented towards organizational and administrative uses of computing. Both programs include study of advanced applications and methodology. The M.A. degree also prepares students for Ph.D. study. The department plays a major role in the Ph.D. Program in Computer Science of the City University of New York.
