Applications for financial assistance are encouraged from students with strong undergraduate preparation in computer science, mathematics, or related fields. Financial aid forms are available from the Financial Aid Office, 308 West Quad.


<div class="callout"> There are roughly 150 students in the graduate program, but only about 5 get assistance each year. Only a few students get assistance in their first semester. Almost no international students receive financial aid from Brooklyn College.

### Teaching Fellowship
A student with a teaching fellowship can teach one or two courses as an Adjunct Lecturer. The stipend can vary between $2,000 and $4,000 per semester. Proficiency in the English language is essential for students seeking teaching fellowships.

There are two types of such fellowships:

1. Those provided by the Ph.D. program. For such a fellowship, apply directly to the Ph.D. program of CUNY (see page 12 for contact information).

2. Those provided by Brooklyn College.

A student who wants to apply for such a fellowship should write a letter to the department chair, Prof. Yedidyah Langsam, with a resume. The applicant should get a recommendation from the Graduate Deputy Chair. The Chair and the Graduate Deputy Chair will make assignments for the limited number of positions.

### Grant Support

For exceptional students, there is an opportunity to work on research projects with faculty members who have grant support. These students must speak to the individual faculty member involved.
