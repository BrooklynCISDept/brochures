<h3> Brooklyn College Computer Facilities </h3>

**Computer Labs**

The ITS Public Computing Labs (in the West End Building) now feature 250 new computers—including Linux workstations, Windows PCs, and Apple Macs—in an inviting open work space. Nearby are lounge areas, study rooms, classrooms, tutoring areas, and a videoconference room. Special services include scanning, DVD writing, and express printing. The lab has been specially designed acoustically to make for a quiet facility.

Linux accounts are automatically assigned to students enrolled in classes which require them. Students who need computer accounts for other purposes should ask at the front desk of the ITS Public Computing Facility.

<h3> Other Computer Facilities </h3>

The CIS Department maintains an Ethernet based network of computers for use by its faculty and other researchers. The network is an Internet node. Many departments have computer based courses. To meet the demand for computers, there are many computer labs distributed around the campus, especially in the library. The Internet Café in Whitehead Hall is open 24 hours per day.

<h3> Brooklyn College Library </h3>

The Brooklyn College Library has numerous computers (see <http://libguides.brooklyn.cuny.edu/computingsvcs>), and it also maintains the Internet Café in Whitehead Hall. There is a New Media Center on the second floor. The library also has numerous computer science research resources available online; see <http://libguides.brooklyn.cuny.edu/cis>.
