This brochure concentrates on the first three programs. Links to information on the Ph.D. Program in Computer Science are provided later in this brochure.

## M.A. in Computer science
The Master of Arts (M.A.) degree in Computer Science is designed for students interested in computer science research, system development, or advanced applications. This program is focused on teaching the student advanced techniques and methodology, in addition to applying standard computer tools. The program is also recommended for students who wish to pursue doctoral studies in computer science.

The M.A. program emphasizes all aspects of computer science. The title "Master of Arts" reflects that it is a broader program than the M.S. in Information Systems, not that it is any less scientifically oriented. In fact, the M.A. program is a more mainstream computer science degree than the M.S.

Professor James Cox is the Graduate Deputy Chair. Students who are entering the M.A. program in Computer Science should meet with Professor Cox (<cox@sci.brooklyn.cuny.edu>).

## M.S. in Information systems
The Master of Science (M.S.) degree in Information Systems is designed for students interested in the applications of computer science to the practical information systems needed for business and administration. The theory of computing is presented with an eye towards practical applications. It is for students who wish to understand the use of the computer as a management tool, its place in organizations for both planning and production, and the organization of complex computer systems so that they are most effective and efficient. Advanced computer tools and their usage are also a focus of study.

<div class="callout">
The M.S. degree is intended for students who wish to become computer systems managers, directors, and executives in such organizations as banks, insurance companies, universities, brokerage houses, etc., or who wish to manage information systems in other industrial or service organizations.
</div>

Current M.S. students are divided into two groups. One group consists of computer professionals already working in industry, and the other group consists of accountants, comptrollers, business executives and administrators who wish to apply computer science to their own fields. Both groups are interested in learning computer science theory and its integration into their own fields.

The Graduate Deputy Chair, Professor James Cox, is in charge of all Master's Degree programs. Students who are entering any of our graduate programs should meet with Professor Cox to discuss their plans.


## M.S. in Health Informatics

The Master of Science (M.S.) degree in Health Informatics focuses on the use of technology in a wide range of health care and medical services. It is designed for students interested in applications of computing and research in computer science as it is utilized in the fields of healthcare and other aspects of health science. The program is focused on teaching the student advanced techniques and methodology, in addition to applying standard computer tools. The program is appropriate for both practitioners of health applications using computers and for researchers in new computer-based methods and measures in health-related fields.
